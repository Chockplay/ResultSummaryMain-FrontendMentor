## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge. The challenge is to build out this results summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The designs are in JPG static format. All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.
